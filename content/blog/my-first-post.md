This is my very first post on this site.

Right now I'm setting up the basic architecture for my personal website using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Markdown**. The goal is to create a clean, minimal, content-first experience inspired by some of my favorite personal sites on the web.

Over time, this blog will include:

- Case studies of projects I've worked on
- Notes on product, data, and AI
- Experiments and side projects
- Reflections on my career journey

This post exists mainly to help me wire up the blog engine and make sure everything is working end-to-end.

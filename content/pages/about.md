Hey, I'm Munthasir. I'm a product-minded business analyst and an aspiring AI product
builder. My passion lies at the intersection of technology, business,
and human-centered design. I thrive on solving ambiguous problems, building
useful tools, and sharing what I learn along the way.

This website serves as my digital garden—a place to document my journey,
share my thoughts, and showcase the projects I'm proud of.

## My Interests
* Exploring the capabilities and ethical implications of AI.
* Building full-stack applications with modern web technologies.
* Writing about productivity, learning, and personal growth.
* Reading non-fiction, especially books on technology and psychology.

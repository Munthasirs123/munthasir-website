I’m based in Greater Boston, MA and work as a Product Owner at CVS Health. Previously, I’ve held product, scrum master & analyst roles driving digital transformation for clients in diverse domains

I am typically the most technical person in a room full of business focused people, and the most business oriented person in a room full of technical people 🙂

In my spare time, I like to build apps, research AI and write about my learnings!
